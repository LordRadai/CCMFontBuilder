# CCMFontBuilder
 This is a command line tool. It loads a list of unicode character codes from `chrlist.txt` and outputs bitmap textures, CCM2 layout file and a plain text layout file for debugging. Usage is `CCMFontBuilder.exe "fontname" size` (e.g. `CCMFontBuilder.exe "MS Gothic" 12`.
 
 It comes with a default chrlist set, but you can create your own by dragging and dropping a CCM2 file on top of `CreateChrListCCM2.exe`
